# Power of Blockchain

## 📘 Project Description
**Power of Blockchain** is a Solidity-based project designed to demonstrate the fundamental strengths of blockchain technology — transparency, immutability, and decentralization.  
This smart contract acts as a simple on-chain ledger, allowing users to deposit, transfer, and view their balances securely on the Ethereum blockchain.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To showcase how blockchain empowers individuals by removing intermediaries and ensuring trust through transparent and immutable transactions.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Decentralized Ledger:** Each transaction is stored on-chain, visible to everyone.
- **Secure Deposits:** Users can deposit Ether directly into the contract.
- **Peer-to-Peer Transfers:** Transfer balances between users seamlessly and securely.
- **Transparency:** Every deposit and transfer emits events, making the system auditable.
